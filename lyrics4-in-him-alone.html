            <p>Chorus:</p>
            <p>
                In him alone is our hope
                In him alone is our strength
                In him alone are we justified
                In him alone are we saved

            <p>Verse 1:</p>
            <p>
                What have we to offer
                That does not fade or wither?
                Can the world ever satisfy
                The emptiness in our hearts?
                In vain, we deny
            </p>

                <p>
                    In him alone is our hope
                    In him alone is our strength
                    In him alone are we justified
                    In him alone are we saved

            <p>Verse 2:</p>
            <p>
                When will you cease running
                In search of hollow meaning?
                Let his love fill the hunger
                In your soul till it overflows
                With joy
                You yearn to know
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Chorus:</p>
            <p>
                In him alone is our hope (in him alone is our hope)
                In him alone is our strength (unto him I pour out my heart)
                In him alone are we justified (he, alone)
                In him alone are we saved (will save me with his love and mercy)
                (2x)
            </p>
